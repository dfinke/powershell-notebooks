## Tips and tricks

- The `%` operator gives you the remainder of a division operation.
- The `if` statement gives you the condition to see if a number should be part of the sum.
- The `for` loop can help you repeat a series of steps for all the numbers 1 through 20.
- Getting a weird answer? try making some print statements of your variables, to see it they're changing unexpectedly.

## Check your answer

Your final answer should be 63.
