# The Basics of Strings

## What is a String?

A string is a sequence of characters. A handy metaphor is a friendship bracelet, where you string together letters to make a name.

#!markdown

## Strings and String Literals

`firstFriend` and `secondFriend` are variables of strings. The last line is also a string. It's a **string literal**. A string literal is text what represents a constant string.

> Try that out with the following code. Press play and see what comes out.
>
> Next, try changing the variables to see different names.

#!pwsh

$firstFriend = "Maria"
$secondFriend = "Sophia"

"My friends are ${firstFriend} and ${secondFriend}"

#!markdown

## String Properties

As you explore more with strings, you'll find that strings are more than a collection of letters. You can find the length of a string using `Length`. `Length` is a **property** of a string and it returns the number of characters in that string.

> Try that out by seeing how long the names of the friends are:

#!pwsh

"The name $firstFriend has $($firstFriend.Length) letters."
"The name $secondFriend has $($secondFriend.Length) letters."

#!markdown

# String Methods

## Leading and Trailing Spaces

Suppose your strings have leading or trailing spaces (also called **white space**) that you don't want to display. You want to trim the spaces from the strings. The `Trim` method and related methods `TrimStart` and `TrimEnd` do that work. You can just use those methods to remove leading and trailing spaces.

> Play around with trimming in the following code.

#!pwsh

$greeting = "      Hello World!       "
$greeting

$trimmedGreeting = $greeting.TrimStart()
$trimmedGreeting

$trimmedGreeting = $greeting.TrimEnd()
$trimmedGreeting

$trimmedGreeting = $greeting.Trim()
$trimmedGreeting

#!markdown

## Replace

You can also replace substrings with other values. For example, in the code below, you can take "Hello World!" and replace "Hello" with "Greetings", to make "Greetings World!"

> Try it out. What else could you replace "Hello" with?

#!pwsh

$sayHello = "Hello World!";
$sayHello
$sayHello = $sayHello.Replace("Hello", "Greetings");
$sayHello

#!markdown

## Changing Case

Sometimes you need your strings to be all UPPERCASE or all lowercase. `ToUpper` and `ToLower` do just that.
> The following example seems a bit mixed up. Can you fix it so "whisper" is all lowercase, and "shout" is all uppercase?

#!pwsh

"WhiSPer".ToUpper()
"sHoUt".ToLower()

#!markdown

# Playground

Now it's your turn to play around with what you've learned. Try these exercises:
> Create three variables of three different people.
>
> Find the length of the first person, make the second person all caps, and the third person all lowercase.
>
> How many letters are in "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"?
>
> How many characters are taken out when you trim "       friendship bracelet     "? Does trimming take out the center space?
>
> What do you want to write?

#!pwsh

"Playground"
"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"
"       friendship bracelet     "
